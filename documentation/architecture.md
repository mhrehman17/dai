# System Architecture Documentation

## Overview
The Decentralized AI System is designed to enable distributed training, privacy-preserving AI workflows, and efficient model orchestration using a microservices-based architecture. The system is built to handle a range of infrastructure environments, from edge devices to large-scale cloud-based deployments, and follows the principles of Zero Trust Architecture to ensure security across the network.

## Key Components
The system is composed of several key components that work together to provide decentralized training, privacy enhancement, secure orchestration, and performance monitoring.

### 1. Orchestrator
The **Orchestrator** is the central coordination entity responsible for:
- Managing the lifecycle of the training workflow.
- Distributing tasks among the participating agents.
- Monitoring and ensuring consistency and synchronization across the decentralized agents.

It supports both **decentralized** and **hierarchical** orchestration models, allowing it to flexibly scale between fully distributed and cloud-coordinated environments.

### 2. Agents
**Agents** are deployed on both edge devices and cloud environments. They are responsible for:
- Local training using their own data (federated learning approach).
- Collaborating with other agents through the peer-to-peer (P2P) network to share learned model updates.
- Supporting adaptive behavior based on their resource capabilities, such as CPU/GPU usage and available memory.

Types of agents include:
- **Training Agents**: Handle local model training.
- **Adaptive Agents**: Optimize their behavior based on available resources.
- **ARM Agents**: Specialized for ARM-based edge devices.

### 3. Blockchain Ledger
A **Blockchain Ledger** is used to provide a decentralized, immutable record of interactions among agents. This includes tracking:
- Participation in training rounds.
- Contributions made by agents.
- Verification of agent activities via **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**.

The blockchain serves as a **trust layer** for decentralized AI training by offering mechanisms for **consensus** and **rewarding agents**.

### 4. Privacy Enhancements
The system employs a variety of privacy-preserving techniques, including:
- **Differential Privacy**: Adds noise to model updates to prevent information leakage.
- **Homomorphic Encryption**: Allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without decrypting it.
- **Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC)**: Ensures privacy in collaborative model training.

These privacy mechanisms ensure that data privacy is maintained while enabling distributed collaboration among agents.

### 5. Model Registry
The **Model Registry** is a versioned storage service for managing model versions and metadata. It includes:
- **Model Metadata**: Tracking accuracy, loss metrics, and timestamp for each version.
- **ONNX Conversion**: Converting models to ONNX format for compatibility with a variety of deployment environments.
- **Encrypted Models**: Supporting model encryption for secure storage.

### 6. Monitoring and Metrics Collection
The **Monitoring System** gathers metrics from agents, orchestrators, and the entire distributed infrastructure to provide insights such as:
- **CPU and GPU Utilization**.
- **Training Progress** and **Accuracy Metrics**.
- **Privacy Compliance** metrics.
- **Blockchain Node Performance**.

The monitoring is facilitated using tools such as **Prometheus** and visualized through **Grafana** or **Streamlit Dashboards**.

### 7. Communication
The system uses a combination of communication protocols:
- **gRPC** for efficient agent-orchestrator communication.
- **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Network** for agent-to-agent interactions.
- **Secure Communication** using **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)** to ensure that data shared between agents is verified and trustworthy.

### 8. Load Balancer
The **Load Balancer** is used to distribute the workload among agents and orchestrators to achieve optimal system performance. It supports:
- **Round-robin**, **least-connections**, and **IP-hash** strategies to distribute incoming tasks.
- Integration with Kubernetes and autoscaling mechanisms to scale up or down based on system demands.

### 9. Kubernetes and Auto-scaling
The system is containerized and orchestrated using **Kubernetes** to provide:
- **Scalability**: Autoscaling agents and orchestrators based on CPU and memory utilization.
- **High Availability**: Ensuring availability by deploying multiple replicas of orchestrators and agents.
- **Network Policies**: Using Kubernetes **NetworkPolicies** to enforce security, limit pod-to-pod communication, and ensure **Zero Trust** networking.

### 10. Security and Zero Trust Architecture
Security is embedded at every level of the system architecture:
- **Zero Trust** principles, ensuring that every access request is verified regardless of network origin.
- **Identity Management** for agents using secure token-based authentication and **JWT**.
- **Rate Limiting** and **Account Locking** to prevent brute force and malicious attacks.

## Data Flow
1. **Data Ingestion**: Data is ingested at the edge devices where agents reside. Each agent trains a local model based on its data.
2. **Model Updates and Sharing**: Agents communicate their locally trained models to the orchestrator or directly to other agents via P2P communication.
3. **Secure Aggregation**: Model updates are aggregated using **secure aggregation** to generate a global model while ensuring privacy.
4. **Blockchain Logging**: Contributions are logged on the blockchain to ensure immutability and transparency.
5. **Model Registry**: The final global model is saved in the model registry, and metrics are collected for monitoring and auditing.

## Deployment Architecture
- **Cloud Deployment**: The system supports deployment on AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud using **Terraform** and **Kubernetes** for scalability and infrastructure as code (IaC).
- **Edge Deployment**: Lightweight **ARM Agents** can be deployed on devices such as **Raspberry Pi** for edge computing scenarios, ensuring real-time data processing without relying heavily on cloud resources.
- **Hybrid Deployment**: Combines edge and cloud to balance real-time processing requirements with scalability.

## Microservices Architecture
The entire system follows a **microservices architecture** where each major component (e.g., orchestrator, agent, blockchain, privacy module) runs as an independent service. This design provides:
- **Loose Coupling**: Each component can be independently developed, tested, and deployed.
- **Scalability**: Services can be scaled horizontally to accommodate more load.
- **Resilience**: Failures in one service do not affect the rest of the system.

## Summary
The Decentralized AI System is a scalable, secure, and privacy-preserving platform for distributed AI training. It leverages advanced technologies including blockchain, privacy-enhancing computation, Kubernetes, and a microservices-based architecture to ensure flexibility and robustness. The architecture is designed to handle diverse workloads ranging from small edge deployments to large-scale cloud infrastructures.
