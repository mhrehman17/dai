# Performance Optimization Guide

## Overview
Performance optimization is a critical part of deploying the **Decentralized AI System** at scale. This guide provides strategies and configurations to enhance the performance of different components, including agents, orchestrators, and models, across distributed and diverse environments such as cloud and edge deployments. The goal is to maximize resource utilization, reduce latency, and improve throughput for both training and inference.

## Key Areas of Optimization
- **Resource Allocation**: Optimizing CPU, GPU, and memory usage.
- **Parallelism**: Configuring the system to take advantage of parallel processing where possible.
- **Load Balancing**: Distributing workload across nodes to avoid resource bottlenecks.
- **Model Optimization**: Techniques such as quantization and ONNX conversion to reduce model size and inference time.
- **Caching and Data Sharding**: Efficient use of caching and sharding to reduce I/O overhead.
- **Network Optimization**: Reducing latency in network communication between distributed nodes.

## Resource Allocation Optimization
### CPU and GPU Management
- **GPU Utilization**: Enable GPU acceleration by setting `gpu_enabled: true` in `configs/performance_config.yaml`. Allocate GPU memory effectively by configuring `gpu_memory_allocation`.
- **CPU Resource Allocation**: Use `cpu_limit` and `memory_limit_mb` settings in the `performance_config.yaml` to ensure that CPU resources are optimally distributed.
- **Resource Manager**: The script `core/utils/resource_manager.py` can be used to monitor and dynamically adjust resource allocation based on workload and node capabilities.

### Kubernetes Resource Requests and Limits
To ensure that pods have the necessary resources while not over-consuming them, specify resource requests and limits in `deployment/kubernetes/deployment.yaml`:
```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "1Gi"
    cpu: "500m"
  limits:
    memory: "2Gi"
    cpu: "1"
```
This configuration helps Kubernetes effectively allocate resources based on available capacity.

## Parallelism and Scalability
### Agent Parallelism
- **Maximize Parallel Agents**: Set `max_parallel_agents` in `configs/performance_config.yaml` to determine the number of agents that can run concurrently without overloading the system.
- **Batch Size and Epochs**: Tuning `batch_size` and `num_epochs` allows for optimal training time without overburdening memory and CPU.
- **Asynchronous Training**: The orchestrator uses asynchronous aggregation where possible to prevent slow nodes from delaying the entire training process.

### Auto-Scaling with Kubernetes
Enable the Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to automatically scale agents based on CPU utilization:
```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta1
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: agent-autoscaler
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: dai-agent
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      targetAverageUtilization: 70
```
The HPA scales the number of agent pods based on resource usage to maintain performance during high-load periods.

## Load Balancing
- **Load Balancing Strategy**: Use the setting `load_balancing_strategy` in the `performance_config.yaml` to specify strategies such as `round_robin`, `least_connections`, or `ip_hash` for the orchestrator.
- **Load Balancer for API Requests**: Configure a load balancer to handle incoming API requests efficiently across multiple nodes. **NGINX** or **HAProxy** can be used for this purpose.

## Model Optimization
### Quantization and Pruning
- **Quantization**: Use the `core/models/model_quantization.py` script to quantize the model weights, reducing their size and increasing inference speed, especially for edge devices.
- **Pruning**: Prune less important neurons from the model to reduce size and computational complexity. This can be particularly useful when deploying models to resource-constrained devices.

### Conversion to ONNX Format
- **ONNX Conversion**: Convert models to the **ONNX** format using the `core/models/onnx_conversion.py` script. ONNX models are lightweight and optimized for inference, which is crucial for edge deployments.
- Example Command:
  ```bash
  python core/models/onnx_conversion.py --input model.pth --output model.onnx
  ```
- Deploy ONNX models on edge devices to reduce inference latency and memory requirements.

## Caching and Data Sharding
### Caching
- **Data Caching**: Enable caching by setting `caching_enabled: true` in `performance_config.yaml`. The system will cache frequently used data to reduce redundant I/O operations.
- **Cache Size Management**: Use `cache_size_mb` and `cache_eviction_policy` (e.g., `LRU`) to ensure that the cache remains efficient.
- **Model Caching**: The orchestrator caches the latest models to avoid repeatedly downloading them from the registry.

### Data Sharding
- **Shard Dataset for Distributed Agents**: Use the `core/data/data_sharder.py` script to split the dataset among multiple agents for parallel processing.
- **Reduce Bottlenecks**: Sharding ensures that data is distributed evenly, reducing I/O bottlenecks and enabling faster parallel training.

## Network Optimization
### Reduce Communication Overhead
- **gRPC Optimization**: The gRPC communication channel between agents and orchestrators is optimized by compressing messages and batching requests wherever possible. Configure these settings in `core/communication/grpc_client.py` and `grpc_server.py`.
- **P2P Communication**: Utilize the **peer-to-peer (P2P)** protocol using the `core/communication/p2p_network.py` for efficient communication between agents without overloading a central orchestrator.

### Connection Settings
- **Connection Timeout**: Use `connection_timeout_sec` and `retry_delay_sec` settings in `performance_config.yaml` to define appropriate values for reducing latency in network requests.
- **Network Policies**: Use **Kubernetes Network Policies** (`network_policies.yaml`) to reduce network chatter between pods, limiting connections only to those needed for core functionality.

## Profiling and Benchmarking
### Performance Profiling
- **Enable Profiling**: Set `profiling_enabled: true` in `performance_config.yaml` to enable system profiling. This helps to identify performance bottlenecks.
- **Profiling Tools**: Use tools like **PyTorch Profiler** or **cProfile** to profile code sections and identify areas to optimize.
- **Profiling Interval**: Configure the profiling interval using `profiling_interval_sec` to gather profiling data at regular intervals.

### Benchmarking Metrics
- **Throughput and Latency**: Measure throughput and latency using Prometheus metrics. Track key performance indicators (KPIs) like `latency_threshold_ms` and `throughput_target_rps`.
- **Visualizing Metrics**: Use **Grafana Dashboards** to visualize metrics such as request latency, agent CPU/memory usage, and model training times. Import pre-configured dashboards from the `core/monitoring/dashboard/` directory.

## Best Practices for Performance Optimization
1. **Use Autoscaling**: Make sure auto-scaling is enabled to handle fluctuations in workload effectively.
2. **Monitor System Resource Usage**: Continuously monitor CPU, GPU, and memory usage to prevent any single node from becoming a bottleneck.
3. **Optimize Batch Size and Epochs**: Tuning the training parameters for each deployment environment can significantly improve performance.
4. **Enable Model Quantization for Edge Devices**: Always use quantized models for edge devices to reduce latency.
5. **Limit Network Traffic**: Use P2P and limit connections through network policies to reduce network overhead.
6. **Profiling and Benchmarking**: Regularly profile system components and conduct benchmarking tests to identify performance issues proactively.
