# Privacy Policy

## Introduction
At **Decentralized AI System**, your privacy is of utmost importance. This privacy policy describes how we collect, use, store, and protect your data while providing services related to decentralized AI training, deployment, and agent management. Our commitment is to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and transparency of user data across all levels of the system.

## Scope
This privacy policy applies to all users of the **Decentralized AI System**, including those using our agents, orchestrators, dashboards, and other related services. This policy also covers data collection from cloud, edge, and blockchain deployments.

## Data We Collect
We collect data to provide better services and enhance the system experience. Data collected may include:

1. **Personal Information**:
   - Name, email address, organization, and contact details during registration.
   - Authentication data such as usernames, encrypted passwords, or OAuth tokens.

2. **System Usage Data**:
   - Information about your use of the system, such as login times, agent interactions, orchestrator events, and API requests.

3. **Training Data and Metadata**:
   - Model metadata such as hyperparameters, version details, and performance metrics.
   - Metrics from training sessions, evaluation results, and data used for federated learning.

4. **Technical Information**:
   - Logs related to errors, system health, resource usage, and monitoring.
   - Device and connectivity information (e.g., IP addresses) for edge and cloud nodes.

## How We Use Your Data
The data collected is used to enhance and provide our services effectively, which includes:

1. **Service Provision**:
   - Authenticating users, managing access, and providing services such as agent deployment, federated learning, and model registry management.
   - Coordinating decentralized training and aggregating model updates.

2. **Improvement of Services**:
   - Using aggregated and anonymized usage data to improve the performance of the system and make enhancements.
   - Monitoring system health and detecting faults or issues in real-time.

3. **Compliance and Security**:
   - Protecting against unauthorized access, fraud, abuse, or data breaches.
   - Ensuring compliance with applicable privacy regulations, industry standards, and ethical AI guidelines.

## How We Share Your Data
- **Within the System**: Data is shared across different services (e.g., agents, orchestrators, blockchain nodes) to perform distributed learning tasks and coordinate model management.
- **Third-Party Integrations**: Limited data sharing occurs with third-party authentication providers (e.g., OAuth for login) or cloud infrastructure providers for deployment purposes.
- **Data Anonymization**: Any data shared with collaborators or third parties is first anonymized to ensure no personally identifiable information is exposed.

## Security Measures
We implement multiple security measures to ensure data protection:

1. **Encryption**:
   - All personal data and sensitive information are encrypted both at rest and in transit using state-of-the-art encryption standards (e.g., AES-256).
   - Communication between agents, orchestrators, and the backend uses **TLS (Transport Layer Security)**.

2. **Access Control**:
   - Role-based access control (RBAC) ensures only authorized personnel can access sensitive data and systems.
   - Authentication logs are monitored continuously for suspicious activity.

3. **Privacy-Enhancing Technologies**:
   - The system includes **differential privacy** to ensure individual contributions to federated models cannot be traced back to specific individuals.
   - **Homomorphic encryption** is used during secure aggregation processes, allowing computations on encrypted data without revealing the underlying information.

## User Rights and Control
You have the following rights regarding your personal data:

1. **Access and Correction**: You can request access to your data and make corrections if necessary.
2. **Deletion Requests**: You may request deletion of your data if you no longer wish to use the system.
3. **Data Portability**: You have the right to receive a copy of the data you have provided in a machine-readable format.

For exercising any of these rights, please contact our privacy support team at `privacy@dai-system.com`.

## Data Retention
We retain user data only for as long as necessary to provide our services or comply with legal requirements. Once data is no longer needed, it will be securely deleted or anonymized.

## Cookies and Tracking Technologies
We use cookies and similar technologies to enhance your experience and provide functionalities such as:
- **Session Management**: Maintaining user sessions during interactions with the web dashboard.
- **Performance Tracking**: Understanding system usage patterns to improve service performance.

Users may disable cookies in their browser settings; however, doing so may limit some functionalities of the system.

## Updates to the Privacy Policy
We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in our services or legal requirements. When we make changes, we will notify users via the web dashboard or email (if provided).

The most recent version of this privacy policy will always be available at our documentation portal.
