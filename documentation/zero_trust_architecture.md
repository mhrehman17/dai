# Zero Trust Architecture Guide

## Overview
The **Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)** is a core security concept integrated into the **Decentralized AI System**. In a Zero Trust model, no entity—whether inside or outside the network—is inherently trusted. Every interaction is authenticated, authorized, and continuously validated to maintain the highest levels of security. This guide explains how Zero Trust is implemented in the system, including access control, authentication, secure communication, and monitoring.

## Key Principles of Zero Trust
- **Verify Explicitly**: Always authenticate and authorize every access request based on all available data points, including user identity, device health, and location.
- **Use Least Privilege Access**: Grant minimal permissions required to perform tasks. This reduces the risk exposure if an entity is compromised.
- **Assume Breach**: Always assume that a breach may occur and implement strategies to limit the impact, including network segmentation and continuous monitoring.

## Zero Trust Components in the System
### 1. Identity Verification and Authentication
- **Authentication Services**: The system includes robust authentication services via the **authentication.py** API endpoint.
  - **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Users can enable MFA to add another layer of security for login.
  - **OAuth Integration**: Support for third-party OAuth services (e.g., Google, GitHub) for enhanced security and usability.
- **Identity Management for Agents**: Agents must authenticate with the orchestrator using identity tokens. The `core/agents/identity_management.py` module handles token issuance and validation for agents.

### 2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Access Policy Definitions**: Access control policies are defined using the `core/communication/access_policy.py` script. This module ensures that agents and users can only access data and services according to their roles.
- **Least Privilege Principle**: Users and agents are only provided with the minimum access required for their tasks. Admin roles are restricted to certain API calls, whereas agents have access limited to specific data sharding and aggregation.

### 3. Secure Communication
- **Mutual TLS (mTLS)**: All communication between system components, including agents, orchestrators, and blockchain nodes, is secured using mutual TLS (mTLS). Certificates are generated using the `scripts/generate_keys.sh` script.
- **End-to-End Encryption**: End-to-end encryption is implemented in communication protocols, leveraging **gRPC** for secure, high-performance connectivity.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)**: Zero-Knowledge Proofs are used in specific parts of the system, such as agent verification (`core/ledger/zkp_verification.py`), allowing an agent to prove ownership or compliance without revealing sensitive details.

### 4. Network Segmentation and Micro-Segmentation
- **Kubernetes Network Policies**: Network segmentation is enforced at the Kubernetes level using **network policies** (`kubernetes/network_policies.yaml`). These policies restrict which pods can communicate with each other, limiting lateral movement in the event of a breach.
- **Micro-Segmentation**: Micro-segmentation is achieved by implementing **service meshes** for each system component, isolating services from each other and enforcing strict ingress and egress rules.

### 5. Device Health Checks
- **Node Health Verification**: The `core/ledger/node_setup/validator_node.py` script includes a health verification mechanism to ensure that nodes participating in blockchain and consensus mechanisms are healthy and uncompromised.
- **Agent Health Status**: Agents are required to report health status periodically to the orchestrator. If an agent fails health checks, it will be disconnected and flagged for manual review. Health status is monitored through the `agent_monitor.py` module.

### 6. Continuous Monitoring and Logging
- **Agent and Orchestrator Monitoring**: Monitoring services such as Prometheus and Grafana (`core/monitoring/`) continuously track agent activities and orchestrator performance.
- **Anomalous Behavior Detection**: Logs are collected and analyzed for anomalies using the `log_collector.py` script. Alerts are triggered if abnormal behavior, such as unauthorized access attempts, is detected.
- **Audit Logs**: Every significant action taken within the system is logged for auditing purposes. Audit logs, stored in `logs/authentication/auth_access.log`, are used to verify that all interactions comply with access policies.

## Implementing Zero Trust in Deployment
### Step 1: Identity Management Setup
- Generate identity tokens for each agent:
  ```sh
  python core/agents/identity_management.py --generate-token --agent-id agent_1
  ```
- Store the generated tokens securely in a location only accessible by authorized agents.

### Step 2: Deploy Secure Communication Protocols
- Enable mTLS for all services:
  - Generate certificates using the key generation script:
    ```sh
    ./scripts/generate_keys.sh
    ```
  - Configure the orchestrator and agents to use these certificates for mTLS.

### Step 3: Define Access Control Policies
- Edit the `access_policy.py` file to configure roles and permissions for all users and agents.
  ```python
  access_policies = {
      "admin": ["view_logs", "manage_agents", "deploy_models"],
      "agent": ["fetch_data", "send_updates"],
      "user": ["view_metrics", "request_model"]
  }
  ```

### Step 4: Apply Network Policies
- Use Kubernetes to enforce network segmentation by applying `network_policies.yaml`:
  ```sh
  kubectl apply -f kubernetes/network_policies.yaml
  ```
- These policies ensure that only specific pods are allowed to communicate, reducing the risk of lateral attacks.

### Step 5: Continuous Monitoring Setup
- Deploy Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring:
  ```sh
  docker-compose -f deployment/docker/compose.yml up prometheus grafana
  ```
- Configure alerts in Prometheus for any policy violations or resource exhaustion events.

## Best Practices for Zero Trust Implementation
1. **Use Short-Lived Tokens**: Use short-lived identity tokens for agents to minimize the impact if a token is compromised.
2. **Rotate Certificates Regularly**: Use automated scripts to rotate certificates and keep communication secure. Certificate rotation scripts are available under `scripts/generate_keys.sh`.
3. **Implement Health Checks**: Regularly perform health checks on nodes and agents to ensure they are uncompromised. Use node health verification mechanisms provided in `validator_node.py`.
4. **Audit Regularly**: Periodically audit access logs (`auth_access.log`) to identify any unusual access patterns.
5. **Minimal Access**: Follow the least privilege principle and regularly review permissions to ensure no entity has excessive privileges.
6. **Adopt a Service Mesh**: Consider using a service mesh (e.g., Istio) for managing inter-service communications securely at scale.

## Summary
The **Zero Trust Architecture Guide** ensures that the **Decentralized AI System** operates with the highest level of security by continuously verifying identities, securing communications, and monitoring activities. Implementing Zero Trust principles minimizes the risk of breaches and provides a secure environment for decentralized model training and deployment.
