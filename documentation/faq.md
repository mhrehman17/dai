# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### 1. What is the Decentralized AI System?
The Decentralized AI System is a platform that allows for the distributed training and deployment of AI models across multiple agents. It utilizes privacy-enhancing technologies, blockchain for trust, and supports both edge and cloud deployment scenarios.

### 2. Who can use this platform?
This platform is designed for data scientists, AI researchers, and enterprises looking to leverage federated learning, decentralized AI workflows, or edge AI deployment. It is also suitable for anyone interested in privacy-preserving AI technologies.

### 3. What are the benefits of using a decentralized AI system?
A decentralized AI system provides several benefits:
- **Privacy**: Data remains on local devices, reducing the risk of privacy breaches.
- **Scalability**: Training can be distributed across multiple devices and locations.
- **Resilience**: No central point of failure, making it more resilient to outages.
- **Edge Support**: Capable of training AI models on edge devices for real-time inference.

## Deployment Questions

### 4. How do I deploy the Decentralized AI System on cloud infrastructure?
Refer to the [Deployment Guide](deployment_guide.md) for detailed steps on deploying the system on AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. Terraform and Kubernetes are used to provision and manage cloud resources.

### 5. Can I run the system on an edge device?
Yes, you can deploy the system on edge devices such as Raspberry Pi. Use the `playbook_edge.yml` Ansible playbook to configure and deploy agents on these devices.

### 6. What are the prerequisites for deploying the system?
The main prerequisites are:
- **Docker** and **Kubernetes** for container orchestration.
- **Terraform** and **Ansible** for infrastructure provisioning.
- **SSH Access** to cloud or edge machines.
More details can be found in the [Deployment Guide](deployment_guide.md).

### 7. How can I set up a hybrid deployment?
You can use a combination of the cloud and edge deployment instructions in the [Deployment Guide](deployment_guide.md) to set up a hybrid infrastructure. This approach allows you to run model orchestration in the cloud while edge devices perform local training.

## Technical Questions

### 8. How is data privacy maintained?
The system uses multiple privacy-enhancing techniques, such as **differential privacy** to add noise to local model updates, and **homomorphic encryption** to ensure secure aggregation of encrypted data. These are described in more detail in the [Privacy Policy](privacy_policy.md).

### 9. How does the blockchain ledger work?
The blockchain ledger records all contributions made by agents during the training process. It ensures that the training process is transparent and that no agent can tamper with the recorded updates. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)** are also used for verifying computations without revealing raw data.

### 10. What models are supported?
The system is designed to be model-agnostic. You can train **deep learning models**, **traditional machine learning models**, and **personalized federated learning models**. The system includes a **Model Registry** for managing different versions of the models.

### 11. Can I use GPUs for training?
Yes, GPU support is enabled through Docker and Kubernetes. The system will automatically leverage GPUs if they are available, which is configured through the `gpu_enabled` setting in the Kubernetes deployment configurations.

### 12. How do I monitor system performance?
Monitoring is handled through **Prometheus** for metrics collection and **Grafana** for visualization. You can also use the `start_dashboard.sh` script in the `examples/federated_dashboard/` directory to start the monitoring dashboard.

## Security Questions

### 13. What security measures are in place?
The system uses **Zero Trust Architecture** principles, meaning no component is trusted by default. Each component is authenticated and authorized before interaction. Additionally:
- **Differential Privacy** protects local data.
- **Homomorphic Encryption** ensures computations can be performed on encrypted data.
- **JWT Tokens** are used for API security and agent authentication.

### 14. How is access to agents controlled?
Access is controlled through **identity management** and **token-based authentication**. Only authorized agents and users can access the orchestrator and participate in the training process.

### 15. What happens in case of a security breach?
In the event of a breach, all agents are automatically **logged out** and **access tokens** are revoked. The system maintains a **blockchain audit trail** to identify malicious behavior and enforce accountability.

## Development Questions

### 16. How do I contribute to the project?
Refer to the [Contribution Guide](contribute.md) for details on how to contribute. Contributions are welcome in the form of feature enhancements, bug fixes, and documentation improvements.

### 17. How do I set up a local development environment?
You can set up a local development environment by installing the required dependencies from `requirements_dev.txt`. Use the `setup_dev_env.sh` script to automate most of the setup.

### 18. What coding standards are followed?
The project follows **PEP8** coding standards for Python code. All code must be well-documented, and changes should be accompanied by unit tests. Detailed guidelines can be found in the [Contribution Guide](contribute.md).

### 19. How do I write and run tests?
Unit tests are located in the `core/tests/unit_tests/` directory. Use **pytest** to run the tests:
```bash
pytest core/tests/
```
All new features and bug fixes must include corresponding tests.

## Troubleshooting Questions

### 20. Agent is not connecting to the orchestrator. What should I do?
- Check if the orchestrator is running and accessible via the configured IP address.
- Verify that the correct orchestrator URL is set in the agent configuration file (`configure_edge.yaml`).
- Ensure there are no firewall rules blocking communication between agents and orchestrators.

### 21. Pods are crashing in Kubernetes. How do I debug this?
Use the following command to view the logs of a crashing pod:
```bash
kubectl logs <pod-name>
```
Common issues could be related to resource limits or incorrect environment variables.

### 22. How do I reset the blockchain ledger?
Navigate to the blockchain ledger directory and run the reset script:
```bash
./reset_ledger.sh
```
This will reset the ledger to its initial state, but it is recommended to do this only in development environments.
