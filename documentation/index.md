# Decentralized AI System Documentation

## Overview
Welcome to the official documentation for the **Decentralized AI System (DAI)**. This documentation provides detailed information about deploying, using, and contributing to the project. The Decentralized AI System is designed to facilitate distributed model training, privacy-preserving computations, and efficient orchestration of AI workflows across a diverse set of infrastructures ranging from edge devices to large-scale cloud environments.

## Key Features
- **Decentralized Training**: Enable federated learning across edge devices and cloud nodes without sharing raw data.
- **Privacy Enhancements**: Built-in privacy mechanisms such as differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, and secure multi-party computation.
- **Scalability**: Supports both cloud and edge deployments, designed to scale with Kubernetes and load balancing.
- **Zero Trust Security**: Follows the Zero Trust Architecture principles to ensure secure interactions across all components.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Leverages blockchain for transparency and trust, providing an immutable record of contributions.
