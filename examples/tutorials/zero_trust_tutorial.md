# Zero Trust Architecture Tutorial

## Overview
**Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)** is an essential approach for enhancing security within the **Decentralized AI System**. In a Zero Trust model, the concept is simple: "Never trust, always verify." This means every entity—whether it is inside or outside the organization's perimeter—must be verified before accessing any resources. This tutorial guides you through setting up Zero Trust principles, including identity verification, secure communication, and access control to safeguard your AI workflows.

## Key Principles of Zero Trust
1. **Verify Explicitly**: Always authenticate and authorize based on multiple signals such as identity, location, and device health.
2. **Least Privilege Access**: Limit each agent or user's access rights to only what is necessary.
3. **Assume Breach**: Treat every access request as though it originated from an open network. Limit exposure and continually monitor for suspicious activity.

## Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Docker**: To manage containers for deploying orchestrators and agents.
- **TLS Certificates**: Set up for mutual TLS authentication.
- **Prometheus & Grafana**: For monitoring and logging suspicious activities.
- **Kubernetes (Optional)**: For large-scale deployments.

## Step 1: Identity Verification and Authentication
### 1.1 Set Up Identity Management
- The **Identity Management Module** (`core/agents/identity_management.py`) is used to manage tokens and identities of participating agents.
- Generate identity tokens for agents:
  ```sh
  python core/agents/identity_management.py --generate-token --agent-id agent_1
  ```
- Tokens are short-lived and must be renewed periodically for enhanced security.

### 1.2 Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Enable **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for user access to the orchestrator.
- Open the **authentication configuration** (`configs/security_config.yaml`) and set:
  ```yaml
  mfa_enabled: true
  ```
- Upon logging in, users will need to enter an additional verification code sent to their email or mobile device.

## Step 2: Implementing Least Privilege Access
### 2.1 Define Access Control Policies
- Access control is managed using the `core/communication/access_policy.py` script.
- Policies should enforce minimal permissions. For example, a data engineer can only access the data shard assigned to them, while an orchestrator admin can control agent coordination.
- Sample access policy configuration:
  ```python
  access_policies = {
      "admin": ["manage_agents", "view_logs", "deploy_models"],
      "agent": ["train_model", "send_updates"],
      "user": ["view_metrics"]
  }
  ```

### 2.2 Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Enforce **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** through the orchestrator and API endpoints (`frontend/api/endpoints/authentication.py`).
- Each role is assigned specific permissions to reduce the risk of unauthorized actions.

## Step 3: Secure Communication with Mutual TLS (mTLS)
### 3.1 Generate Certificates
- Secure communications are crucial in Zero Trust. Use mutual TLS to validate both the client and server.
- Generate the TLS certificates for orchestrators and agents using the provided script:
  ```sh
  ./scripts/generate_keys.sh
  ```
- Store certificates in the `certs/` directory and update agent and orchestrator configuration files accordingly.

### 3.2 Configure mTLS in Agents and Orchestrators
- Update orchestrator settings (`configs/app_config.yaml`) to enable mTLS:
  ```yaml
  tls_enabled: true
  cert_file: "certs/orchestrator_cert.pem"
  key_file: "certs/orchestrator_key.pem"
  ```
- Similarly, configure the agents to require mTLS by adding the appropriate settings.

## Step 4: Network Segmentation
### 4.1 Define Network Policies
- Apply **Kubernetes Network Policies** to enforce segmentation and prevent unauthorized lateral movement between components.
- Use the policy provided in `kubernetes/network_policies.yaml` to define strict ingress and egress rules:
  ```yaml
  kind: NetworkPolicy
  metadata:
    name: zero-trust-policy
  spec:
    podSelector:
      matchLabels:
        app: dai-agent
    policyTypes:
    - Ingress
    - Egress
    ingress:
    - from:
      - podSelector:
          matchLabels:
            app: orchestrator
    egress:
    - to:
      - podSelector:
          matchLabels:
            app: orchestrator
  ```
- This ensures that only specific pods, like agents and orchestrators, can communicate with each other.

## Step 5: Continuous Monitoring and Incident Response
### 5.1 Monitoring Metrics with Prometheus and Grafana
- Deploy Prometheus and Grafana using Docker Compose for monitoring and visualization:
  ```sh
  docker-compose -f deployment/docker/compose.yml up prometheus grafana
  ```
- Monitor agent activities, resource usage, and suspicious access attempts from the Grafana dashboard (`http://localhost:3000`).

### 5.2 Log Collection and Analysis
- Use the **Log Collector** (`core/monitoring/log_collector.py`) to collect logs from agents, orchestrators, and blockchain nodes:
  ```sh
  python core/monitoring/log_collector.py
  ```
- Analyze logs for anomalies. Alerts will be generated when unusual behavior is detected, such as multiple failed authentication attempts.

### 5.3 Anomaly Detection and Alerts
- Use **Prometheus Alertmanager** to trigger alerts if specific thresholds are exceeded, such as CPU usage or unauthorized access attempts.
  - Example alert rule (in `configs/monitoring/alert_rules.yaml`):
    ```yaml
    groups:
    - name: security.rules
      rules:
      - alert: UnauthorizedAccessAttempt
        expr: count_over_time(security_access_denied[5m]) > 5
        for: 1m
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: "Multiple unauthorized access attempts detected"
    ```

## Step 6: Device Health and Compliance
### 6.1 Device and Node Health Verification
- Each agent must periodically report health metrics to the orchestrator.
- Run `core/ledger/node_setup/validator_node.py` to perform compliance checks on nodes:
  ```sh
  python core/ledger/node_setup/validator_node.py --validate-health
  ```
- Unhealthy nodes are flagged for manual review and disconnected from the orchestrator to maintain system integrity.

### 6.2 Automated Security Tests
- Schedule security tests using scripts in `core/tests/security_tests/` to verify that each agent complies with Zero Trust policies. The tests include:
  - **Access Control Test**: Ensures proper enforcement of role-based policies.
  - **Health Check Verification**: Tests if the nodes meet compliance requirements.
