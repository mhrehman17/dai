## 5. Model Training Workflow

- **Model Training and Deployment Pipeline**
  - Validate complete MNIST model training initiated via the `mnist_training_agent.py` script.
  - Verify data loading (`mnist_data_loader.py`) is done correctly, preprocessing steps are applied, and data is sharded (`data_sharder.py`).
  - Test the deployment of trained models to edge devices after ONNX conversion (`onnx_conversion.py`).

- **Synthetic Data Generation**
  - Generate synthetic data using (`synthetic_data.py`) and train a model using that data.
  - Validate model accuracy using the generated data (`evaluate_mnist.py`) to ensure expectations are met.

## 6. Peer-to-Peer and Secure Communication Workflow

- **gRPC Communication**
  - Test secure gRPC connections between agents and orchestrator (`grpc_client.py`, `grpc_server.py`).
