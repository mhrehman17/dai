# Decentralized AI System

Welcome to the **Decentralized AI System** project. This is an advanced framework to facilitate distributed AI model training and orchestration across multiple nodes while maintaining high privacy standards and a decentralized architecture.

## Project Overview

The Decentralized AI System enables distributed training and deployment of AI models across various devices ranging from small-scale edge devices to large-scale cloud infrastructure. Key features include:

- **Federated Learning**: Distributed model training without sharing data, enhancing privacy.
- **Privacy and Security**: Integration of differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, and Zero Trust Architecture.
- **Multi-Agent System**: Multiple collaborative agents for training, monitoring, and resource management.
- **Edge and Cloud Integration**: Support for running on edge devices as well as cloud-based infrastructures.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Uses blockchain for audit trails, model versioning, and agent incentives.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed before setting up the project:

- **Python 3.8+**
- **pip** (Python package manager)
- **Docker** (for containerized deployments)
- **Node.js and npm** (for frontend development)
- **Uvicorn**, **Streamlit**, **Alembic** (as part of Python dependencies)

## Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd dai_project
   ```

2. **Set up the virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup_dev_env.sh
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up the database**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/migrate.sh
   ```

5. **Generate keys for secure communication**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/generate_keys.sh
   ```

## Running the Project

### Running the Backend (API)

Start the FastAPI server by running:

```bash
cd frontend
./run_frontend.sh
```

The API should now be available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

### Running the Monitoring Dashboard

To start the interactive monitoring dashboard:

```bash
./scripts/start_dashboard.sh
```

The dashboard will be accessible at [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501).

## Deployment

This project is designed to run across different environments, including edge devices and cloud servers.

### Docker Compose

For a quick multi-container setup using Docker Compose:

```bash
cd deployment/docker
docker-compose up
```

### Kubernetes Deployment

Use the provided Kubernetes YAML files for a production-ready deployment:

```bash
cd deployment/kubernetes
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

### Terraform (Cloud Setup)

Provision cloud resources using Terraform:

```bash
cd deployment/terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
```

## Running Tests

### Unit Tests

To run unit tests:

```bash
pytest core/tests/unit_tests/
```

### Performance Tests

To run performance tests using Locust:

```bash
./scripts/performance_tests.sh
```

## Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Monitor agent activities, training progress, and resource utilization in real time.
- **Zero Trust Security**: Incorporates Zero Trust principles for authentication and data access.
- **Adaptive Orchestration**: Automatically scales and adapts to resource constraints.
- **Blockchain-Ledger**: Uses blockchain for decentralized orchestration, audit, and incentives.
